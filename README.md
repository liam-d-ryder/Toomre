# Toomre
A MATLAB project of the Toomre galactic model

Based on code completed in the class, PHYS 410. The parameters of the galaxy collision are those that my professor suggested, and the code was updated based
on his solutions and critique of my work. These particular parameters show a "glancing" collision where the galaxies remain intact after their interaction.
The pdf includes all of the necessary theoretical background on gravitation and the finite difference approximation used, as well as convergence testing to 
show that the model is accurate and consistent.
